#len() is a Python function that returns the number of items in an object, like a list, string, or dictionary.

nums = [2, 7, 11, 15] #list
#The length of nums is the total number of elements in that list.

#len(nums) will return 4 because there are 4 elements in the nums list:
nums[0] = 2
nums[1] = 7
nums[2] = 11
nums[3] = 15

print(len(nums))
