'''
The abs() function in Python returns the absolute value of a number.
So, if you have abs(i - j), it simply means you're interested in the distance between the two indices i and j, regardless of whether i is greater than j or not.

For example:

abs(3 - 5) will return 2.
abs(5 - 3) will also return 2.
